## Description

This is our submission for our final group project for UofT Bootcamp. We have used the skills and technologies we have learned over the past six weeks, including Performant JS, NoSQL databases, Progressive Web Applications, React single-page applications, GraphQL APIs, Concurrent servers in a MERN app and Authentication.

Mobile-first design is built on the fact that users increasingly use their mobile devices to interact with web applications. An application that provides users with the best performance and flexibility is likely to win out over its competitors.

## User Story
AS a LEARNER I WANT to efficiently remember facts in a gamified way SO THAT I can consistently recall facts at will
GIVEN sets of decks to study from WHEN I select a deck THEN the game loads this deck's contents to be reviewed WHEN a flashcard shows up THEN I can select an answer from three possible options WHEN I select an incorrect answer THEN the card will show more frequently in the future WHEN I select a correct answer THEN the card will show less frequently in the future WHEN I complete a game (of 15 cards) THEN I get a summary of how much points I have earned in this session WHEN I do particularly well in each game THEN more cards from the deck will be added to the pool WHEN my score reaches certain milestones THEN I will have earned a badge to show off on my profile
GIVEN my competitive nature in this gamified environment WHEN I open my profile page THEN I see my avatar, cumulative score, and badges I have earned WHEN I open the leaderboard page THEN I can see how my score compares with other players WHEN I click on another player's profile THEN I can see their avatar, cumulative score, and badges
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
